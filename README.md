# **üìö NovelNavigator: A Smart Book Recommender System**

**NovelNavigator** is an intelligent book recommendation system designed to help users discover books that align with their interests. It utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and user ratings to provide personalized recommendations based on book summaries.

## **üöÄ Features**

- **üîç Smart Recommendations**: Recommends books by analyzing the content of book summaries using NLP.
- **üìñ Contextual Understanding**: Leverages BERT to understand the meaning behind the text, ensuring more accurate recommendations.
- **‚≠ê Hybrid Approach**: Combines text similarity with user ratings to enhance recommendation quality.
- **üë§ User Interaction**: Allows users to search for books and receive tailored recommendations.

## **üì• Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/novelnavigator.git
cd novelnavigator
```

### **2. Set Up a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Configure the Google Books API**
- Obtain an API key from the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
  ```bash
  GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```

### **5. Run the Application**
```bash
python app.py
```

## **üõ†Ô∏è Usage**

1. **Input Search Terms**: Enter your preferred genre, author, or book title.
2. **View Recommendations**: The system suggests books based on similarity to the input and user ratings.
3. **Explore Details**: Click on a recommended book to view more information, including a summary, author, and ratings.

## **üîß How It Works**

### **1. Data Collection**
- **Source**: Book data (titles, summaries, authors, etc.) is fetched using the Google Books API.

### **2. Text Preprocessing**
- **Techniques**: Tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization are applied to prepare the text.

### **3. Contextual Embeddings with BERT**
- **BERT**: A pre-trained model is used to convert summaries into vectors that capture the meaning and context of the text.

### **4. Similarity Calculation**
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between book summaries to identify contextually related books.

### **5. Recommendation Generation**
- **Hybrid Method**: Combines text similarity and user ratings to rank and recommend books.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **BERT**: For deep understanding of text.
- **Google Books API**: For fetching book data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Flask/Django**: (Optional) For the web interface.

## **üìö Example Scenarios**

### **Example 1: Fantasy Book Recommendations**
- **Input**: "Harry Potter"
- **Output**: Books like "Percy Jackson" and "The Hobbit."

### **Example 2: Science Fiction Book Recommendations**
